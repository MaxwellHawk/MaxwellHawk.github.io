### Algorithm Development in Single-cell RNA-seq quantification, July 2018 - Current, UCLA

I developed an algorithm called ANT that transforms the genome alignment results to build TCC-matrix (transcript compatibility counts matrix, an expression quantification matrix). The algorithm's workflow, codes and more details can be found [here](https://github.com/KevinBastianYang/ANT).

* Tested on 3381 mouse cell data, ANT showed an effciency in saving useful information such as the raw reads and the umis. Also, ANT is competitive in terms of speed at cell level.

### Computational prediction of arsenic binding proteins, March 2018 - July 2018

* I built a computational tool to predict arsenic binding proteins based on position-specific score matrix (PSSM) and single-mutation profiles. 

* I Built a web server for the computational prediction and functional analysis of arsenic binding proteins in human cells. People can access to the server to find the motif. Corresponding work is currently summarized.

- Web Development & Data Collection & Model Construction  , March 2017 - March 2018

Participated in the Shanghai Jiao Tong 15th College students’ innovative practice plan with project "Drug combination database and predictive model construction based on drug and target information" in 2017. I was in charge of the front end development of the database, collection of the data, and co-designed the predictive model. We successfully built the database and implemented the predictive model which showed a good predictive ability. The project received an A in the final presentation and I received an A+ in the presentation.
