## Constrained Stress Model in Unified Framework, Augest 2018 - Augest 2018, ZJU

I developed an algorithm called ANT that transforms the genome alignment results to build TCC-matrix (transcript compatibility counts matrix, an expression quantification matrix). 
* Code and more details can be found [here](https://github.com/KevinBastianYang/ANT).
* Tested on 3381 mouse cell data, ANT showed an effciency in saving useful information such as the raw reads and the umis. Also, ANT is competitive in terms of speed at cell level.
* The revisited stress model can incooperate with various user constraints, of which some i accomplish such as the direct constraints, the metrics-based constraints and shape-based constraints.

## Mentor Recommendation System based on data mining, March 2018 - July 2018, SJTU

* I built a computational tool called Arsenic Finder to predict arsenic binding proteins based on position-specific score matrix (PSSM) transformed by single-mutation free energy profile. The tool is freely available [here](http://47.254.78.183:8000/server/). The development is based on Django + Nginx + uWSGI.

* Our work was invited for an oral presentation at the 2018 International Comference on Computational Systems Biology. The full manuscript has been submitted to *Quantitative Biology* for publication.

## Drug Combination Database and Predictive Model Construction Based on Drug and Target Information, March 2017 - March 2018

### Database Construction
* Based on Django framework, I developed the front end of the database, which links the drugs, drug combinations, and target information.

### Drug Combination Prediction 
* An ensemble machine learning model is used. The base classifiers are NB, SVM, adaBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost. The meta classifier is XGBoost. The following shows the workflow of the prediction model.

* AUC Results of different algorithms on test set.

* The project received an A (highest) in the 15th Undergraduate Innovation Program in Shanghai Jiao Tong University and I received an A+ (highest).
