### Algorithm Development in Single-cell RNA-seq quantification, July 2018 - Current, UCLA

I developed an algorithm called ANT that transforms the genome alignment results to build TCC-matrix (transcript compatibility counts matrix, an expression quantification matrix). The algorithm's workflow, codes and more details can be found [here](https://github.com/KevinBastianYang/ANT).

* Tested on 3381 mouse cell data, ANT showed an effciency in saving useful information such as the raw reads and the umis. Also, ANT is competitive in terms of speed at cell level.

### Computational Prediction and Functional Analysis of Arsenic Binding Proteins in Human Cells, March 2018 - July 2018

* I built a computational tool to predict arsenic binding proteins based on position-specific score matrix (PSSM) and single-mutation profiles. The tool is freely available [here](http://47.254.78.183:8000/server/).

* Our work was invited for an oral presentation at the 12th International Comference on Computational Systems Biology. The full manuscript has been submitted to *Quantitative Biology* for publication.

### Drug Combination Database and Predictive Model Construction Based on Drug and Target Information, March 2017 - March 2018

#### Database Construction
* Based on Django framework, I developed the front end of the database. The following is the framework of the database.

* The project received an A (highest) in the 15th College Students’ Innovative Practice Plan in Shanghai Jiao Tong University and I received an A+ (highest).
