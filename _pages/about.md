* My research advisors are Prof.Chaochun Wei (SJTU), Prof.Jingfang Wang (SJTU) and Prof. Wei Wang (UCLA).

Research Interest
======
I have a broad interest in the field of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Current major interest is in Computational Genomics, especially in biological sequence analysis methods development, as well as their downstream applications in biology and medicine.
Past and ongoing related topics are:

* Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, method development, downstream biological interpretation

* Funtional element discovery in genomes, specifically, method development in alternative splicing prediction

* Bioinformatics related online tools development
